/*
In Javascript We can declare variables by using var,let keyword
var is blocked level and let is scope level
it is good to use let keywords variable instead of var
*/

/*
anything that you don't want to change then const keyword comes into the action.
meaning that if you declare as const keyword the value can not be updated or modified.
*/

/*
variables are containers to storing the data.
*/


/*
if we declare the variables but not initialized the variable the value is printed as undefined.
